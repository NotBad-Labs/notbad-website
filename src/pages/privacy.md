# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 23, 2026*

## 1. Information We Collect

NotBad Labs' primary product design philosophy is **local-first**. For apps like SnapDrill, your study data (images of mistakes, cropped questions, and review schedules) is stored securely on your local device. We do not transmit or store this content on our servers.

## 2. On-Device Artificial Intelligence

We utilize Apple's CoreML and Vision frameworks to process text and images directly on your iPhone or iPad. This means no internet connection is required for core extraction features, completely eliminating the risk of personal study data interception during cloud transmission.

## 3. iCloud Sync

You may optionally enable iCloud synchronization for data backup across your personal devices. This process relies entirely on Apple's encrypted iCloud infrastructure. NotBad Labs does not have a "backend database" containing your synchronized homework answers.

## 4. Diagnostics and Telemetry

With your explicit OS-level consent, Apple may provide us with anonymous crash reports to help improve software stability. These reports do not contain personal identifiers or your saved data.

## 5. Contact Information

If you have questions about how we handle your data, contact us:
**Email:** <hello@notbadhq.com>
**Address:** NotBad Labs L.L.C. 30 N Gould St Ste 44347, Sheridan, WY 82801
