# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: February 23, 2026**

## 1. Introduction

NotBad Labs L.L.C. ("NotBad Labs," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This Privacy Policy governs your access to and use of our applications, websites, and services, including **SnapDrill** (collectively, the "Services").

Our primary architectural philosophy is **Local-First**. We believe that your data, especially educational and personal study materials, belongs entirely to you.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect (Local-First Architecture)

Unlike traditional cloud-based applications, **SnapDrill** operates entirely on your device.

* **Image Processing**: We utilize Apple's CoreML and Vision frameworks to process images (e.g., homework photos, exam corrections) directly on your iPhone or iPad hardware.
* **Data Transmission**: **We do not transmit your user-generated photos, cropped questions, or review schedules to any external servers.** NotBad Labs does not have a backend database containing your personal study data.
* **Offline Functionality**: Core extraction features work without an active internet connection, eliminating the risk of personal data interception during transmission.

## 3. Information We May Collect Automatically (Telemetry)

To ensure the stability and continuous improvement of our Services, we may collect aggregated, anonymous telemetry data:

* **Crash Reports**: With your explicit, OS-level consent (via Apple's analytics sharing settings), we receive anonymous crash reports to diagnose software bugs. These reports do not contain Personal Identifying Information (PII) or user-generated content.
* **Analytics**: We may use privacy-preserving, cookieless web analytics on our marketing website (notbadhq.com) to understand generalized traffic patterns.

## 4. iCloud Synchronization

You may optionally enable Apple iCloud synchronization to back up your study data across your personal devices.

* This synchronization relies entirely on Apple's end-to-end encrypted iCloud infrastructure.
* NotBad Labs cannot access, decrypt, or retrieve your iCloud data. Your relationship regarding this data is exclusively with Apple Inc.

## 5. Global Privacy Rights (GDPR & CCPA)

We recognize and support global privacy frameworks, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

Because your data resides exclusively on your local device or your personal iCloud account, the execution of your data rights (Right to Access, Right to be Forgotten, Right to Data Portability) is entirely within your control.

* **To delete your data**: Simply uninstall the SnapDrill application from your device and delete the associated iCloud backup.
* **To access your data**: Use the built-in export features within the application to save your study materials locally.

## 6. Children's Privacy (COPPA)

While SnapDrill is designed as a study companion for K-12 students, we strictly adhere to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Because our architecture is strictly local-first, **we do not collect, process, or store any Personal Identifying Information (PII) from children under the age of 13**. Parents have full transparency and control over the app's data usage via iOS settings.

## 7. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may routinely update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in legal or regulatory obligations. We will notify users of material changes via an in-app notice or by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.
